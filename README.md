## Source collections included in this repository

* This repository contains academic information about the students of the University of Coimbra, from 1537 until the early 20th century. 
In 1537 the university was relocated 
* from Lisbon to Coimbra by King John III. It remained the only university in Portugal until 1911 (a Jesuit university centered on Theology existed in Évora from 1559 to 1752), when other universities were created in Lisboa and Oporto, ending the multi-secular monopoly of Coimbra on higher education in the Portuguese speaking world.
* The kleio source file included in this repository are an interpretation of the 
  student records kept at the Arquivo da Universidade de Coimbra, available online at http://pesquisa.auc.uc.pt/details?id=264605 .
