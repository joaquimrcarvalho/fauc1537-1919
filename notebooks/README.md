# Notebooks

This folder contains Jupyter notebooks that interact with the FAUC database.

In order to use the notebooks you need to install VSCode, the Python interpreter and support libraries.

1. Install VSCode from https://code.visualstudio.com/download
2. Install the Python VSCode extension from  https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python
3. After restarting VS Code and set up your environment as instructed in step 2, install the support libraries:
    * Open a terminal in the  menu `Terminal` -> `New terminal`
    * Type ``pip install -r notebooks/requirements.txt`` or if, you are on a windows terminal
         ``pip install -r notebooks\requirements.txt``

You will also need a copy of the FAUC test database.
